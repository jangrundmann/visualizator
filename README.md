##Summary

Our task in this project is to develop a web application, which uses the Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformation (XSLT) to transform Apache Camel Routes, written in an `.xml` file, into `.svg` picture.
Eventually, the produced picture will be shown on webpage.

This transformation should cover the needs of the [Silverspoon.io project] (https://silverspoon.io).

##Usage

As this is a maven project, you should be able to open it in every maven-supporting IDE. But we recommend IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate and Netbeans with JAVA EE bundle.

1. First of all you need to download the zip with the sources. To do this, just press the `Download ZIP` button on the right side.
2. As this is a web application, you will need a server to run it on. We recommend you to download and use the [Apache Tomcat] (https://tomcat.apache.org/download-80.cgi).
3. Now it's time to extract downloaded files. When extracting Apache Tomcat, remember, that it is usefull to extract it into folder, that you have write permission on.

###IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate
1. Open the IntelliJ IDEA.
2. Click on File-->Open.
3. In dialog shown, go to folder, where the project is unpacked, and choose the file `pom.xml` from project folder.
4. Now wait a moment, while IDEA prepares everything important.

###Netbeans

2. Click on File-->Open project, or press `Ctrl+Shift+O`.
