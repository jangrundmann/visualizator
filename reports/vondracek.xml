            For this project I did image representation of BeagleBoneBlack hardware. For this I have used svg technology. 
            Next part of my work was creating a component witch is able to read configuration xml file and visualize 
            BeagleBone board with respect to given configuration. To solve this problem i have used xslt technology as 
            other members of the team.

           Most beneficial thing on this project was that I have learned little bit about github and possibilities that
           markup languages offer.
