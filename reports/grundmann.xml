            My work on this project comprised creating svg files for CubieBoard2 and then developing XSLT mainly for CubieBoard2
            but it was almost universal for all other boards. This work required to adopt advanced procedures used in XSLT which were
            new and beneficial for me.
            Also advanced XPath expressions were necessary during developing of XSLT.
